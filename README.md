# Three-Stage Yolov8 Framework for ID-Card Forgery Detection Based on Copy-Paste Induced Boundary Artefacts


This is a novel three-stage computer vision framework as a sustainable engineering solution that integrates YOLOv8, a powerful deep learning model for object detection, with the Error Level Analysis (ELA) technique to authenticate scanned images of ID cards.
